# GHR
Generalized Hyperbolic Regression Modeling for Survival Data

This is the final project of STAT 440: Computational Inference (Winter 2018) at University of Waterloo.

The final report can be found in **report.pdf**. The dataset we used is the `colon` dataset in R's `survival` package. 
All functions developed for this project can be found in **functions** folder. The code for data analysis and for validating the correctness of the functions can be found in **analysis.R**.

keywords: Bayesian Inference, Gibbs Sampling, MCMC, Survival Analysis
